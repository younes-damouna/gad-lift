###  **GadLift**  is built using the following technologies:

- This project uses the [Flutter app development framework](https://flutter.dev/). Flutter is a cross-platform hybrid app development platform which allows us to use a single codebase for apps on different platforms including mobile, desktop, Linux, Android, IOS,MacOs, Windows and the web.
- The admin panel is done using [React.js](https://react.dev/). React.js is a JavaScript library for building single-page applications out of individual pieces called components.
- To send  notifications, the app uses the [firebase_messaging ](https://pub.dev/packages/firebase_messaging) package which supports Android, iOS.

- For the backend side the project done with [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/)
which is a progressive Node.js framework that helps build server-side applications. Nest extends [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) frameworks like Express or Fastify adding modular organization and a wide range of other libraries to take care of repetitive tasks. Itâ€™s open-source, uses [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and it is a very versatile Node.js framework for building backend systems. It helps scale Node.js servers and supports several databases.

- The project uses [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/). Which is an open-source, nonrelational database management system (DBMS) that uses flexible, JSON-like documents instead of traditional tables and rows to process and store various forms of data12. As a NoSQL database solution, MongoDB provides an elastic data storage model that enables users to store and query multivariate data types with ease.

- For the IOT part the project uses [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) which is is a professional, cross-platform tool for embedded systems engineers and software developers1. It supports multiple frameworks and is compatible with a wide range of microcontroller boards, including Arduino and other MCU boards.
  
- The app uses the font [Zen Dots](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Zen+Dots) as its main font, and the design of the app adheres to the material design guidelines.
